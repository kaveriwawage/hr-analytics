HR Analytics Data Analyst Project
Introduction:

Welcome to my HR Analytics Data Analyst project! In this project, I explored the intersection of human resources and data analytics to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that inform strategic decision-making within organizations. Leveraging my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques, I delved into various HR datasets to extract actionable insights that drive employee engagement,retention, and performance improvement initiatives.

Project Goals:
Employee Turnover Analysis: Analyze historical turnover data to identify factors contributing to employee attrition and develop retention strategies.
Recruitment Analytics: Evaluate recruitment metrics such as time-to-fill, cost-per-hire, and quality-of-hire to optimize hiring processes and improve candidate sourcing strategies.
Performance Management Analysis: Assess performance review data to identify high-performing employees, areas for improvement, and factors influencing performance outcomes.
Employee Engagement Analysis: Analyze survey data and employee feedback to measure employee engagement levels and identify drivers of engagement.
Diversity and Inclusion Analytics: Explore diversity metrics to assess representation across various demographic groups and promote diversity and inclusion initiatives.
Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast future workforce trends, attrition rates, and talent needs.
